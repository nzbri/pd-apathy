# Data Overview

This contains some exploratory visualisations of the raw data: predominantly
simple overviews of demographics and some quality control measures.

### Consistency of NPI administration

The figure below shows a large number of missing sessions in 2015. This was due
to different data collection procedures at the start of the PET study, and as
these were mostly new participants this is also responsible for the large spike
in missing NPI assessments in baseline sessions (discussed with Kyla Horne,
28/10/2020).
